# DroneReqValidator

DroneReqValidator (DRV) is a complete Drone simulation ecosystem that automatically generates realistic environments, monitors Drone activities against predefined safety parameters, and generates detailed acceptance test reports for effective debugging and analysis of Drone software applications. 

# DroneWis

DroneWis is a CFD-based wind simulation component that is integrated with DroneReqValidator. It is used to automatically simulate the wind flow in the environment.

## DRV + DroneWis

Instruction for ASE 2024 reviewers:

Switch to branch `ASE-docker` 

Use the docker compose.yaml file to run the complete system. 
```bash
docker-compose up
```
Then download DRV_1.0.0 from the [link](https://sluedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ankit_agrawal_1_slu_edu/ElbD1q-O8fBFgGDqov6Mh5EBsJ90YyPj2fzsIznTP6AX-w?e=XZaPiX)

Unzip and run the Blocks.exe file to start the simulation.

now you can interface the ecosystem using the UI at http://localhost:3000
