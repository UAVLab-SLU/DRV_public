# DroneWorld Installation for Windows

## Unreal Engine Application
There are two ways to open the unreal application, editor mode and executable mode,
editor mode allows real time adjustment to the environment but requires unreal engine.
The executable mode does not require unreal engine. 
### Editor mode

you need to download the content and extract it to the game folder.

1. Download the "Content.rar" from 
https://sluedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ankit_agrawal_1_slu_edu/ElbD1q-O8fBFgGDqov6Mh5EBsJ90YyPj2fzsIznTP6AX-w?e=XZaPiX

using password: DroneWorld

2. Extract it to the project folder in `unreal_app/editor_mode`.

If you do not download the patch, the unreal editor will not be able to load the project.

https://sluedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ankit_agrawal_1_slu_edu/ElbD1q-O8fBFgGDqov6Mh5EBsJ90YyPj2fzsIznTP6AX-w?e=XZaPiX
